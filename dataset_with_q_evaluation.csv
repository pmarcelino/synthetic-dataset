",How are LLMs trained?,"LLMs, or Language Model Models, are trained on enormous bodies of data. However, it is important to note that they are not trained on your specific data. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is introduced as a solution. RAG allows you to add your own data to the existing data that LLMs have access to. This means that you can incorporate your specific data into the training process, enhancing the model's ability to generate relevant and accurate responses. The documentation mentions RAG frequently as it is a key component in training LLMs with personalized data.",Not useful
