There you will be able to cancel/modify it through Stripe.How does Mendable work?Our application syncs with your documentation and support channels, then uses your docs and previously answered questions to suggest possible answers.Are you open-source?We are starting to open source some of our technology, but currently most of it is not.

Without the key, you won't be able to setup the search component.InstallationInstalling Mendable Searchnpm install @mendable/search
ConfigurationIn the docusaurus.config.js file, add the following:customFields:{
    mendableAnonKey: ""YOUR_ANON_KEY"",
},
Install and run swizzle commandnpm i swizzle
Select the theme you'd like to swizzle. Normally it is the first option it appears.If you'd like to implement the Search Bar Component, select the SearchBar, otherwise for the Floating Button, select the Footer.Once you run swizzle, you will be prompted to either wrap or eject the component. Select eject from the menu as it is a safer option.Search Bar ComponentReplace or edit your src/theme/SearchBar.js with the code below. In this example we are using the Mendable Search Bar. .import React from 'react'
import { MendableSearchBar } from '@mendable/search'
import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext'

export default function SearchBarWrapper() {
  const {
    siteConfig: { customFields },
  } = useDocusaurusContext()
  return (
    <div className=""mendable-search"">
      <MendableSearchBar
        anon_key={customFields.mendableAnonKey}
        style={{ accentColor: '#179C54', darkMode: false }}
        placeholder=""Search...""
        dialogPlaceholder=""How to deploy this application?""
      />
    </div>
  )
}
Floating Button ComponentReplace or edit your src/theme/Footer.js with the code below. In this example we are using the Mendable Floating Button.import React from 'react'
import Footer from '@theme-original/Footer'
import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext'
import { MendableFloatingButton } from '@mendable/search'

export default function FooterWrapper(props) {
  const {
    siteConfig: { customFields },
  } = useDocusaurusContext()

  return (
    <>
      <MendableFloatingButton anon_key={customFields.mendableAnonKey} />
      <Footer {...props} />
    </>
  )
}
Keyword SearchWe also provide keyword search as seen on the Langchain Documentation. This combines keyword with AI Search in one modal. When the user starts typing, it will almost instantly display results for the search query. It also allows the user to use AI search by pressing ""Ask Mendable AI"".To enable keyword search, you need to pass the showSimpleSearch prop to the component.import { MendableSearchBar } from ""@mendable/search""

<MendableSearchBar anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY' showSimpleSearch />
Additional customization (Optional)In some Docusaurus websites, the UI might get too busy in when viewing in mobile, so we recommend you to reduce the width of the search bar in mobile view. In the src/css/custom.css file, add the following:/* Reduce width on mobile for Mendable Search */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .mendable-search {
    width: 200px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 500px) {
  .mendable-search {
    width: 150px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 380px) {
  .mendable-search {
    width: 140px;
  }
}

human: what is mendable
ai: Mendable is a platform that provides chat-powered search through components. It allows you to provide detailed, accurate, and contextually relevant answers to your customers' questions based on your documentation. Mendable also offers an API where it can be used to integrate Mendable's ingestion and completion capabilities into your own applications. 

Mendable has 4 main components:
1. Mendable Search Bar: A component similar to a search bar input. When the user clicks the search bar, it will open a modal with Mendable Search.
2. Mendable Floating Button: A fixed button to the bottom right of the screen that will open a modal with Mendable Search.
3. Mendable InPlace Component: This component is the Mendable Chat only, does not include an activation component or dialog transitions, making it easy for you to create your own activations on top of it.
4. Mendable Chat Bubble: A fixed button to the bottom right of the screen that will open a modal with Mendable Search. It is similar to the floating button, but it is a small bubble that will expand when the user clicks on it.

Mendable also provides a Python SDK for interacting with its API. The SDK supports features like ingesting data sources and asking questions. 

In addition, Mendable offers a variety of parameters to customize your requests through its API. You can also provide conversation history to maintain context and improve the quality of the AI's responses.

[ACTUAL QUESTION BASED ON VERIFIED SOURCES AND PREVIOUS MESSAGES]:
how do i use the search bar

Begin!
Dynamic VariablesMendable's custom prompt interface provides a variety of dynamic variables that can be integrated into a prompt to tailor and enhance its functionality. None of these variables are required for Mendable to work!{company}Usage: This variable is designed to represent the name of the company or organization that the user is associated with. It is set based on your organization name in Mendable. By integrating the {company} variable, the generated response will include the specific company name, ensuring that answers are personalized and contextually relevant to the user's organization.{additional_context}Usage:The {additional_context} variable provides extra information or context that can aid in generating a more precise and accurate response. You can send additional context via the API or the component. It can contain background data, supplementary details, or any other information that should be considered when formulating a response.{retrieved_data}Usage: This variable contains the verified sources that the system can use to extract and base its answers on. Enclosed between [START VERIFIED SOURCES] and [END VERIFIED SOURCES], it ensures that the generated responses are rooted in trustworthy and verifiable data.{history}Usage: The {history} variable provides access to previous interactions or messages in the ongoing conversation. By referring to {history}, the system can generate responses that are consistent with previous answers and can maintain context throughout the conversation. This ensures continuity and relevance in prolonged interactions.{question}Usage: This dynamic variable is pivotal as it drives the main content of the response, it is the user input. It tells the system what the user wants to know based on verified sources and previous messages, ensuring that the answer is directly aligned with the user's intent. You do not have to use it as a ""question"" but in most cases it is used in this way.{support_prompt_addition}Usage: If the system cannot find an answer within the verified sources but can provide some support based on previous interactions, it can use {support_prompt_addition} to append customer service link set in the dashboard to the prompt.Prompt TemplatesTo streamline the process, especially for common use cases, we provide prompt templates. These preformatted prompts are optimized for specific scenarios and require minimal adjustments.Using a TemplateSelect a Template: In the 'Prompt Templates' section, you can browse through various pre-constructed prompts designed for diverse use cases.Precise Mode: By default, the model uses the 'Precise Mode' prompt template. This template is crafted to generate the most relevant and concise responses. It's particularly useful for straightforward questions or when looking for specific information.Normal Mode: This template is crafted to generate answers that use the verified sources and the models external knowledge. It's particularly useful for creative exercises like code generation.Customize as Needed: While these templates are ready to use, you can further customize them to suit your specific needs. Feel free to add any of the dynamic variables or additional context to make the prompt more applicable to your situation.Previous← Ingesting your docsNextShowcase →On this pageOverviewPrompt StructureDynamic VariablesPrompt Templates",https://docs.mendable.ai/prompt_customization,"{""title"":""Prompt Customization - Docs"",""language"":null,""description"":""Customizing the Prompt on Mendable.""}"

Use these functions to gain insights into how users are interacting with the search bar.Metadata Filtering (Beta)You can filter out sources based on metadata on the component level. This is useful if you want to filter out sources based on the version of the document or any other metadata you have ingested. Metadata ingestion is currently only available through the /ingestDocuments endpoint.To use metadata filtering on the component level, use the metadata prop in your component:<MendableSearchBar
  anon_key=""YOUR_ANON_KEY""
  metadata={{
    version: { $lte: 6 },
    age: { $eq: 22 },
  }}

The metadata parameter is an object that contains the metadata you want to filter on. The key is the name of the metadata and the value is an object that contains the operator and the value you want to filter on.The above example will filter in only the sources that have a version less than or equal to 6 and an age equal to 22.Metadata supports the following operators:$eq - equal to (string, int, float)$ne - not equal to (string, int, float)$gt - greater than (int, float)$gte - greater than or equal to (int, float)$lt - less than (int, float)$lte - less than or equal to (int, float)$in - matches any value in an array (string, int, float)It currently does not support and, or operators, but we plan to support them soon.Previous← Floating ButtonNextChat Bubble →On this pageMendable InPlace Component (Beta)UsageKeyword SearchPropsCallback functionsExampleExampleExampleMetadata Filtering (Beta)",https://docs.mendable.ai/components/in-place,"{""title"":""Mendable InPlace Component - Docs"",""language"":null,""description"":""Using Mendable InPlace Component.""}"

It helps guide the AI's responses and ensures the information you receive is relevant and concise. To aid in this process, we provide prompt templates + dynamic variables to quickly create prompts for any use case. You can edit your prompt on the workshop page in the Mendable dashboard.Remember these best practices:Clarity is Key: Whether using a template or crafting your own, clarity in your prompts will greatly enhance the accuracy and relevance of the model's responses.Context Matters: Provide sufficient context, especially when the subject matter is complex or multifaceted. Proper context helps the model understand the nuances of the prompt better.Use Variables Wisely: Variables can personalize and enhance responses, but they should be relevant to the prompt. Irrelevant data can confuse the model and lead to inaccurate responses.Prompt StructureYour custom prompt will look different to the model based on the dynamic variables you send through it. Below is an example of what a prompt looks like before and after inserting real data in the place of the variables.Before Inserting DataYou are a nice and helpful human educator who is part of the {company} team. Given the following verified sources and a question, create a Final answer in markdown.

{additional_context}

Remember while answering:
    * The only verified sources are between START VERIFIED SOURCES and END VERIFIED SOURCES.
    * Only display images and links if they are found in the verified sources
    * If displaying images or links from the verified sources, copy the images and links exactly character for character and make sure the URL parameters are the same.
    * Only talk about the answer, do not reference the verified sources.
    * Do not make up any part of an answer. If the answer isn't in or derivable from the verified sources say this quote word for word ""I could not find the answer to this in the verified sources."".
    * If the answer isn't in or derivable by the verified sources nor the history say this quote word for word ""I could not find the answer to this in the verified sources."".
    * Try to include useful images and code snippets when appropriate. 
    * Wrap relevant code snippets in triple backticks, with the appropriate language followed by a line separator.  
    * You have access to the previous messages in the conversation which helps you help you answer questions that are related to previous questions. Always formulate your answer accounting for the previous messages.

It is trained on your product's documentation, and can be deployed anywhere within your App.What's the difference between a copilot and a normal QA AI?Application context. With a copilot you can feed users' details, page details of the application, and other dynamic information to the AI to get personalized answers.Implementing a product copilotBefore install, make sure you have either signed up through our platform or we have provided you with the ANON_KEY. Without the key, you won't be able to setup the search component.1. Importing a componentImport any component into your React application. For this example let's suppose the component is inside the user settings page of an application.npm i @mendable/search@latest
import { MendableFloatingButton } from ""@mendable/search""

const style = { darkMode: false, accentColor: ""#123456"" }

const floatingButtonStyle = {
    color: ""#fff"",
    backgroundColor: ""#123456""
}

<MendableFloatingButton 
    anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY'
    style={style}
    floatingButtonStyle={floatingButtonStyle} />
2. Passing application contextTo pass in dynamic context to the AI, we can use the context parameter in the component. Here you can send details such as the user settings so the AI is aware of it.import { MendableFloatingButton } from ""@mendable/search""

const style = { darkMode: false, accentColor: ""#123456"" }

const floatingButtonStyle = {
    color: ""#fff"",
    backgroundColor: ""#123456""
}

<MendableFloatingButton 
    anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY'
    style={style}
    floatingButtonStyle={floatingButtonStyle}
    context={
        ""Here are user details to help you answer user's specific questions: ""
        + ""user_id: "" + user.id,  + ""\n""
        + ""user_name: "" + user.name,  + ""\n""
        + ""user_email: "" + user.email,  + ""\n""
        + ""project_id: "" + project.id,  + ""\n""
    } />
3. That's it!Play around with the component and see how useful it is for your use case. You can put the component in multiple pages to have multiple additional contexts and leverage page information to get personalized answers.Listening for messagesTracking messagesYou can listen for messages from the Mendable AI by using the onMessageForTracking prop. This prop takes in a function that takes in two parameters: question and answer.const onMessageForTracking = (question, answer, sources) => {
    // Perform an action
}

<MendableSearchBar
    anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY'
    style={style}
    onMessageForTracking={onMessageForTracking} />
The question parameter is the question that the user asked and the answer parameter is the answer that the AI generated.Listening for message ratingsYou can listen for message ratings from the Mendable AI by using the onRateClicked prop. This prop takes in a function that takes in 4 parameters: message_id and isLiked, question, answer, sources.const onRateClicked = (isLiked, question, answer, sources) => {
    // Perform an action

isLiked is a boolean that is true if the user liked the answer and false if the user disliked the answer. question is the question that the user asked and the answer parameter is the answer that the AI generated. sources is an array of sources URLs that the AI used to generate the answer.Example: Listening to Messages in SlackYou can listen to messages in Slack by using the onMessageForTracking prop. You can then just send the message to a Slack webhook that you can set up at https://api.slack.com/apps.The example below shows it in Next.js, but you can use it in any framework. With a few lines of codes you can receive all your Mendable messages in Slack.
sendSlackMessage(question, answer){
    fetch(""api/sendSlackMessage"",{
        // ...
    })
}
<MendableSearchBar

          sendSlackMessage(question, answer);
     }}

Use these functions to gain insights into how users are interacting with the search bar.Metadata Filtering (Beta)You can filter out sources based on metadata on the component level. This is useful if you want to filter out sources based on the version of the document or any other metadata you have ingested. Metadata ingestion is currently only available through the /ingestDocuments endpoint.To use metadata filtering on the component level, use the metadata prop in your component:<MendableSearchBar
  anon_key=""YOUR_ANON_KEY""
  metadata={{
    version: { $lte: 6 },
    age: { $eq: 22 },
  }}
/>
The metadata parameter is an object that contains the metadata you want to filter on. The key is the name of the metadata and the value is an object that contains the operator and the value you want to filter on.The above example will filter in only the sources that have a version less than or equal to 6 and an age equal to 22.Metadata supports the following operators:$eq - equal to (string, int, float)$ne - not equal to (string, int, float)$gt - greater than (int, float)$gte - greater than or equal to (int, float)$lt - less than (int, float)$lte - less than or equal to (int, float)$in - matches any value in an array (string, int, float)It currently does not support and, or operators, but we plan to support them soon.Previous← In PlaceNextPython →On this pageMendable Chat BubbleUsageCallback functionsExampleExampleExampleMetadata Filtering (Beta)",https://docs.mendable.ai/components/chat-bubble,"{""title"":""Mendable Chat Bubble - Docs"",""language"":null,""description"":""Using Mendable Chat Bubble component.""}"

"Building context-aware AI copilots with MendableSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedSeptember 7th, 2023Building context-aware AI copilots with MendableUtilizing application context to provide more personalized answers to your users.In the ever-evolving world of AI, the race is always on to enhance user experiences and reduce customer support. Enter Mendable's product copilots, the next step towards creating more personalized AI chatbots, ready to change the way users interact with your app. Let's dive deep and explore how you can amplify your app’s capabilities with Mendable.

What is a Product Copilot?
A product copilot is a Mendable component that is trained to answer questions about your product that take in dynamic application context. It is trained on your product's documentation, and can be deployed anywhere within your App.
Copilots Vs. Traditional QA AI: What Sets Them Apart?
At first glance, a copilot might seem similar to a conventional QA AI, but there's a significant difference - the ability to utilize application context to provide personalized answers. With a copilot, you can integrate dynamic information, such as user details and page specifics of the application, to craft bespoke, insightful responses, making the user experience richer and more intuitive.
How to Create Your Own Product Copilot with Mendable
Getting started with creating a product copilot is very straightforward. But first, ensure you are registered on our platform and have the ANON_KEY ready.
Step 1: Integrating a Component
Begin by implementing a Mendable component into your React application. In this instance, we will be adding the component to a fictional user settings page.
npm i @mendable/search@latest

Next, add the following code snippet to your application:
import { MendableFloatingButton } from ""@mendable/search""

const style = { darkMode: false, accentColor: ""#123456"" }

const floatingButtonStyle = {
    color: ""#fff"",
    backgroundColor: ""#123456""
}

<MendableFloatingButton 
    anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY'
    style={style}
    floatingButtonStyle={floatingButtonStyle} />

Step 2: Passing in the application context
To pass in dynamic context to the AI, we can use the context parameter in the component. Here you can send details such as the user settings so the AI is aware of it.
import { MendableFloatingButton } from ""@mendable/search""

const style = { darkMode: false, accentColor: ""#123456"" }

const floatingButtonStyle = {
    color: ""#fff"",
    backgroundColor: ""#123456""
}

<MendableFloatingButton 
    anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY'
    style={style}
    floatingButtonStyle={floatingButtonStyle}
    context={
        ""Here are user details to help you answer user's specific questions: ""
        + ""user_id: "" + user.id,  + ""\n""
        + ""user_name: "" + user.name,  + ""\n""
        + ""user_email: "" + user.email,  + ""\n""
        + ""project_id: "" + project.id,  + ""\n""
    } />

Step 3: Voila, You are Ready!

"Customizing Your LLM Model on Mendable.aiSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedJune 20th, 2023Customizing Your LLM Model on Mendable.aiUse the custom prompt feature to take control of your modelOne of the key features of Mendable is the Custom Prompt feature, which offers several use cases to enhance your chatbot's performance and provide a tailored experience for your customers. In this tutorial, we will focus on the three main use cases of the Custom Prompt feature: Hallucination Gatekeeping, Maintaining Voice, and Structure/Format Control. By making edits in the custom prompt, we can customize the output of our answers. This example will be trained on the Mendable docs.
Use Case 1: Hallucination Gatekeeping
One of the main use cases of the custom prompt feature is hallucination gatekeeping. This allows you to control the chatbot's responses to unpredictable or potentially harmful inputs. By customizing your prompt on Mendable, you can guide the chatbot to provide accurate and safe responses. Let's dive into an example:
Example
Let's say our product requires a high degree of accuracy, and we want to prevent the model from 'guessing', ensuring it is 100% confident that the answer or information about the answer can be found in the documentation.
Before the prompt change, I asked Mendable ""How does Mendable's ClickUp Integration work?"". We do not have a ClickUp Integration (yet). Here is the output:

Notice how the chatbot tried to answer anyways. To prevent this, we only need one sentence! In the custom prompt we can write: ""If nothing is picked up in the information retrieval, say 'Sorry, I don't have the answer for that. Please contact support at help.mendable.ai for assistance!'"".

Now... let's test with the same query to see if our custom prompt change is successful.

Awesome! We just prevented a hallucination! Feel free to experiment with different prompts and refine them based on your specific requirements.
Use Case 2: Maintaining Voice
Maintaining Voice is crucial for creating a consistent user experience. The Custom Prompt feature allows you to define specific language patterns, tones, or styles that align with your brand or product. Let's try it out!
Example
In this example, we'll focus on a couple of ways to bring our company's voice to life. Let's build:

A nice introductory message to make the user feel welcomed
A supportive voice when the user is running into issues

Let's jump back into the custom prompt. Starting with the introductory message, let's input something like ""At the beginning of the conversation, say 'Welcome to Mendable and thanks for reaching out!'"".
By specifying this message at the beggining of the conversation, we've pinned the welcome message to only appear on the first message of the conversation.
Additionally, we can sense the tone of our customer's voice. If we sense that they're frustrated, we can customize a message to be as helpful and supportive as possible. I'll set this up as such: ""If the user is running into issues, say 'I'm sorry you're running into issues! I'll try my best to help'. Then try to answer. After the answer, say 'If this answer didn't help, please reach out to support at help.mendable.ai!'""
We've taken a few steps to improve CX:

Given a tone to be understanding and helpful as the user works through their error
Tried to answer the question
Given a clear and easy outlet to the company support channel in the event that this issue supersedes the bot's ability.

Here is everything that was added to the custom prompt:

As expected, we have our welcome message in the first message of the conversation:

In our follow up question, we didn't specifially say that we were 'running into issues'. However, the way we wrote the prompt allows the model to detect the negative tone in the question the user asked, and it will use the prompted response as a result:

Congrats! You've now learned how to get started matching your company's voice to its LLM.
Use Case 3: Structure and Format
Custom Prompt empowers you to guide the chatbot's responses according to your desired structure and formatting requirements. Let's explore an example:
Example
Sometimes the answer is outputted in one main large paragraph, which can be difficult to read. Here's an example of what this looks like:

To combat this, I'll just put in a short prompt. In your answer, start a different key point in another paragraph.
With this quick change, we can make the format a bit easier to digest. Testing the same question, here is the new output:

Much easier to read! This is just one of many ways you can customize the format to your liking.
Conclusion:
We covered three main use cases of the Custom Prompt feature in Mendable: Hallucination Gatekeeping, Maintaining Voice, and Structure/Format. By customizing prompts, you be confident that your chatbot provides accurate, consistent, and controlled responses. Feel free to explore more prompts and experiment with different scenarios to enhance your chatbot's conversational capabilities.

"Early Insights Fine-Tuning GPT 3.5 from Mendable.aiSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedAugust 24th, 2023Early Insights Fine-Tuning GPT 3.5 from Mendable.aiFinetuning insights with Mendable dataAt Mendable.ai, we are committed to making search more intelligent, efficient, and context-aware for your business. It's a constantly evolving landscape out there, with new tools and technologies continually shifting the game. That's why we were particularly excited about OpenAI's recent update that introduces fine-tuning capabilities for GPT-3.5.
The Buzz Around Fine-Tuning
For the uninitiated, fine-tuning is a feature that allows you to tweak pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5 to better suit specific use-cases or contexts. The ramifications of this are enormous: improved answer performance, contextual understanding, and a more personalized experience for the end-users. However, like any promising technology, the devil is in the details. Here are some early insights we gained from our experiments:
The Challenge of Gathering a Good Dataset
The cornerstone of effective fine-tuning is an appropriate training dataset. But gathering such a dataset isn't always easy or straightforward. There are platforms like Mendable.ai (yes, that's us!) and LangSmith by Langchainai that allow you to capture user-rated completions. The value of this feature can't be overstated. Real-time, user-validated data can significantly enhance the performance of a finely tuned model.
Of course, manual or synthetic dataset creation is an option if you're starting from scratch, but it tends to be time-consuming and less accurate.
Transforming Training Data Matters
Once you've amassed a decent dataset, your next mission is to transform it strategically. You might wonder why this is important. Well, specific transformations can lead to marked improvements in performance. For example, eliminating repeated instructions but retaining the same desired completion can make the model more efficient, saving you valuable tokens in the process.
OpenAI Makes It Easy
After these preliminary steps, the fine-tuning process itself is surprisingly straightforward, thanks to OpenAI's intuitive API. A shoutout to the OpenAI team for their stellar work. We managed to get fine-tuning up and running in under an hour, which speaks volumes about the API's usability.
A Peek Into the Future
While we're talking about fine-tuning, it's hard not to consider the future possibilities this feature holds. Could we see an integrated fine-tuning option right within Mendable.ai's platform for OpenAI and even open-source models? Well, we don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it's an exciting avenue we're exploring.We use tracking cookies to understand how you use the product and help us improve it!

"Everything you need to know about Mendable: Build and deploy AI Chat SearchSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedSeptember 12th, 2023Everything you need to know about Mendable: Build and deploy AI Chat SearchA complete guide to setting up a successful AI chat botIntroduction to Mendable
​
Mendable is a platform that provides chat-powered search functionality to businesses. It's designed with a developer-centric approach, offering a series of powerful and highly customizable components. Another important aspect of Mendable's design is its data agnosticism. This means that Mendable can work with many types of data, regardless of its structure or format. You can ingest data through a simple online GUI or through Mendable's API, and you can easily add, modify, or delete different types of sources. This makes it easy to get Mendable up and running with your existing data sources.
​
At the heart of Mendable is a robust API that integrates LLM capabilities into your applications. This easy-to-use interface connects your data sources with the chat interface, allowing you to deploy complex queries, retrieve comprehensive answers, and create a user experience that's truly intuitive and engaging.
​
Mendable also comes with an interactive user interface that allows for team collaboration, easy ingestion of data, customization of models, and assembly of components, all with a user-friendly and intuitive design.
​
​
How Can I Make the Most out of Mendable?
​
Mendable is specifically designed to be modular, so you have the power to make your own custom chatbot solution in a fraction of the time. This modular nature and data agnosticism makes it easy to get up and running allowing you to customize your projects to fit the needs of individual teams.
​
To make the most out of Mendable, we suggest reading up on our resources at mendable.ai/blog as well as our docs. Additionally, you can contact the founders whenever you'd like at garrett@mendable.ai!
​
​
Setting up the Environment
Invite Your Team
​
If you are part of a team, you can invite your team members! To do this, go to the team section of the dashboard and enter the emails of the members you'd like to have as a part of your project.

​
Ingesting Your Materials
​
Mendable offers a variety of data connectors that you can use to ingest your data. These data connectors are:
​

Website Crawler
Documentation Websites
GitHub
YouTube
Sitemap
OpenAPI Spec
Files (markdown, txt, and pdf)
Pasting Text
​
We also offer a few OAuth connectors:
​
Confluence
Google Drive
Notion
Zendesk

If you are looking for one that is not listed, we are happy to add it for you! Please reach out to us
​

Ingest via the API
If you'd like to ingest via the API, you can do so by going to our docs.
Reingestion
​
You need to update your data, and we want to make sure that we keep the bot updated as well. In this case, we can set up automatic reingestion. We are currently working on adding this to the self serve, but for now please reach out to garrett@mendable.ai to get this set up.
​
If there are any data connectors that aren't available, or ones that you are having issues with, feel free to reach out to us!
​
Your First Test
​
So you've signed up, invited your team, and ingested the relevant data. Now it's time to make your first test! In terms of best practices, we suggest a few things:

Start out by trying a few questions



Choose your model

By default, we offer three different models: GPT4, Claude-2, and GPT3.5. Overall, GPT4 has the best performance and has the largest context window. This is especially relevant if you have a large number of documents in your project.
​
GPT3.5 is the fastest model (the answers generate quicker than GPT4). However, it loses context, so it is best used with minimal documents.
​
Claude-2 is a great alternative to GPT4. It doesn't perform as well, but is better than GPT3.5 and is also cheaper. Additionally, it is a very good model for making summaries and lists.
​
If you'd like, you can use duplicate project in the project settings of the dashboard to create three identical projects, and then you can test a set of questions against all three models.
​

Come up with an evaluation set
​
From our experience, we've seen teams have the most success when they come up with a list of questions (around 20). These should be real questions you get from your users, or ones that are designed to ensure the ingestion process was successful. As you test, you can rate the response as good or bad. This will allow you to do actions such as teach model as well as evaluate the data ingested. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions on evaluation!
​
​

Troubleshooting
​
Sometimes you don't get exactly the answers you are looking for. There could be a few reasons why this is the case.
​


The bot is saying it couldn't find information on the topic you asked about
​
This is likely due to either an ingestion issue or a non-relevant query. For example, if I were to add my API docs and ask, ""who is the president of the United States?"", we won't pick up any sources that relate to that query. Additionally, if your API docs weren't ingested correctly, this may be an issue in the ingestion process. By looking at the chunks on the data sources that were retrieved, you should be able to identify this issue.
​


Hallucinations
​
If the answer seems ""sort of"" correct, or they are made up, this is likely due to hallucinations. This occurs more often if you have your model creativity set to normal. It would be best to check the sources that were retrieved in the answer and check to make sure the answer is present. If not, it could have been an ingestion issue. If the chinks are present, then using teach model to tailor the answer would be the best solution.
​


The answer is mostly correct, but could use some additional detail.
​
Sometimes you get an answer you like, but that extra bit of context would make it perfect. In this case, you can use the teach model feature to add that context.
​
​


Customizing the Model
​
You can customize the model in Mendable in several ways to fit your specific needs. These customizaitons can be found in the workshop section of the dashboard. Some of these include:
​
Model Choice:
We offer GPT3.5, Claude-2, and GPT4 out of the box. Additionally, bring your own keyfunctionality is available for enterprise plans.
​
Creativity:
The two options for model creativity are precise and normal
​
Precise and normal modes differ in one way. Normal uses the underlying training data for the LLM models to help answer questions, while precise only uses the ingested data sources to answer. If your use case involves ""creativity"", such as assistance with code generation, then normal is the preferred option. If your use case specifically requries accurate and focused answers, then precise would be the preferred option.
​
Custom Prompt:
The custom prompt allows you to control the voice of your model as well as the structure. Additionally, you can use it to do hallucination gatekeeping. Feel free to read more on our blog post about the custom prompt: https://www.mendable.ai/blog/customprompt
​

Teach Model
​
Teach model is a powerful feature that enables you to ""take control"" over what Mendable outputs. There are three use cases in which teach model tends to be the most powerful.
​

You want to add extra detail in the answer
You want to 'edit' an incorrect answer
You want to provide additional information to your customers that doesn't necessarily ""fit"" anywhere in the documentation.
​
When you're teaching the model, you can access this by going to the conversations section of the dashboard and clicking on an individual message, or by going to the teach model section. The teach model section is divided into three sections: poorly rated, well rated, and taught questions. In this case, it is pretty easy to go into the poorly rated questions, evaluatate why they were not helpful, and quickly edit the answer if necessary.
​
Once an answer is edited, this answer will be prioritized if the exact question (or a semantically similar one) is asked in the future.
​
Additionally, we can add connect specific documentation sources with the answer, if you want to link your customers somewhere to read more.
​
​

Exporting Conversation Data
Mendable also allows conversation data to be exported. As of right now, this is a feature that is reserved for enterprise contracts. If this is a necessity, please reach out to the Mendable team at help@mendable.ai!
​
​
Deployment
​
Now you've uploaded your content, tested, taught the questions that you needed to, and you're ready to deploy to production! Mendable offers a variety of different ways to implement your AI Chat Search.
​
Components
Mendbale offers a variety of pre-built components in React as well as vanilla JS, making it easy to embed almost anywhere. Additionally, if you prefer to build your own custom front end, you can use our API.

​
White Labeling
Mendable also offers white labeling for the enterprise plan. However, if white labeling is a requirement, please reach out to help@mendable.ai to get this set up.
​
Intergrations
As well as embedding our component, we also offer a pre-built discord bot and slack bot to easily integrate Mendable in your communities and teams.
​
Protection and Security
​
In the project settings section of the dashboard, Mendable offers a couple of protections to keep your bot secure. A couple of things you can do are whitelisting domains and IP address Rate Limiting
​
​

Select the theme you'd like to swizzle. Normally it is the first option it appears.If you'd like to implement the Search Bar Component, select the SearchBar, otherwise for the Floating Button, select the Footer.Once you run swizzle, you will be prompted to either wrap or eject the component. Select eject from the menu as it is a safer option.Search Bar ComponentReplace or edit your src/theme/SearchBar.js with the code below. In this example we are using the Mendable Search Bar. .import React from 'react'

Keyword SearchWe also provide keyword search as seen on the Langchain Documentation. This combines keyword with AI Search in one modal. When the user starts typing, it will almost instantly display results for the search query. It also allows the user to use AI search by pressing ""Ask Mendable AI"".To enable keyword search, you need to pass the showSimpleSearch prop to the component.import { MendableSearchBar } from ""@mendable/search""

<MendableSearchBar anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY' showSimpleSearch />
Additional customization (Optional)In some Docusaurus websites, the UI might get too busy in when viewing in mobile, so we recommend you to reduce the width of the search bar in mobile view. In the src/css/custom.css file, add the following:/* Reduce width on mobile for Mendable Search */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .mendable-search {
    width: 200px;
  }
}

"Improving GPT-3.5, Insights from Mendable.aiSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedAugust 11th, 2023Improving GPT-3.5, Insights from Mendable.aiBoost 3.5 with Mendable TipsIn the bustling world of AI, developers and businesses are constantly seeking ways to optimize and refine their models, ensuring more consistent and accurate results. At Mendable.ai, having processed countless messages via OpenAI's GPT-3.5, we've gained valuable insights into how developers can enhance the model's performance. Today, we're sharing some of the valuable lessons we've learned, particularly around the significance of repetition and structured prompts.
1. Repetition is More Than Just a Rhetorical Device
When it comes to guiding AI, repetition stands out as a tool of paramount importance. Through our exhaustive testing and iteration processes, we found that embedding instructions 2-3 times within a prompt dramatically improved model compliance. But, it's not about mere repetition; it's about variety. The trick lies in rephrasing the instructions differently each time.
For instructions deemed critically important, our recommendation is to strategically place them towards the end of the prompt, right before the model completion. This positioning acts as a reinforcing reminder for the model, ensuring that the vital directive isn't lost or overlooked.
2. The Art of Structured Prompts
While repetition provides a foundation, the structure of your prompt serves as the scaffolding that holds the entire interaction together. The structure may differ based on use cases, but one effective strategy we discovered involves wrapping the prompt's instructions within tags, such as [INSTRUCTIONS].
This strategy was also endorsed by other industry experts like Anthropic, who suggests that different components of the prompt can benefit from being encapsulated within specific tags. Our rigorous testing confirms this. By segregating and tagging elements of your prompt, you provide the model with a clearer blueprint, making the AI's response more aligned with the desired output.
The Mendable.ai Advantage
Developers understand the potential time drain that arises from constantly tweaking and refining AI prompts. But what if there was a way to streamline this process, ensuring optimized performance without the associated headache?
Enter Mendable.ai.
We provide a robust platform designed to expedite the process of building enterprise-grade AI chat applications. Say goodbye to wasted engineering hours and let us help you craft the most effective prompts for GPT-3.5, ensuring you harness its full potential effortlessly.
In summary, understanding and mastering the nuances of prompt optimization can be the difference between mediocre AI interactions and stellar AI-powered conversations. As we move forward, the tools and insights we gain will be crucial in realizing the full potential of language models. Mendable.ai is committed to being at the forefront of these advancements, providing invaluable tools and insights to the broader AI community.We use tracking cookies to understand how you use the product and help us improve it!

const style = { darkMode: false, accentColor: ""#123456"" }

<MendableSearchBar anon_key='YOUR_ANON_KEY' style={style} />
You can also customize the search bar style using the searchBarStyle prop. Here is an example:<MendableSearchBar
  searchBarStyle={{
    backgroundColor: '#1F2937',
    borderColor: '#6B728033',
    color: '#E1E3E7',
    shadow: false,
  }}
/>
Keyword SearchWe also provide keyword search as seen on the Langchain Documentation. This combines keyword with AI Search in one modal. When the user starts typing, it will almost instantly display results for the search query. It also allows the user to use AI search by pressing ""Ask Mendable AI"".To enable keyword search, you need to pass the showSimpleSearch prop to the component.import { MendableSearchBar } from '@mendable/search'

The function receives the question and the answer as parameters. This can be used for logging or analytics purposes.Exampleimport MendableSearchBar from 'mendable-search-bar'

function MySearchComponent() {
  const handleOnMessage = (question, answer, sources) => {
    console.log('User asked:', question)

  console.log('User liked the question?', isLiked)
  // Add tracking or logging logic here
}

;<MendableSearchBar anon_key=""YOUR_ANON_KEY"" onRateClicked={handleOnRating} />
Use these functions to gain insights into how users are interacting with the search bar.Metadata Filtering (Beta)You can filter out sources based on metadata on the component level. This is useful if you want to filter out sources based on the version of the document or any other metadata you have ingested. Metadata ingestion is currently only available through the /ingestDocuments endpoint.To use metadata filtering on the component level, use the metadata prop in your component:<MendableSearchBar
  anon_key=""YOUR_ANON_KEY""
  metadata={{
    version: { $lte: 6 },
    age: { $eq: 22 },
  }}
/>
The metadata parameter is an object that contains the metadata you want to filter on. The key is the name of the metadata and the value is an object that contains the operator and the value you want to filter on.The above example will filter in only the sources that have a version less than or equal to 6 and an age equal to 22.Metadata supports the following operators:$eq - equal to (string, int, float)$ne - not equal to (string, int, float)$gt - greater than (int, float)$gte - greater than or equal to (int, float)$lt - less than (int, float)$lte - less than or equal to (int, float)$in - matches any value in an array (string, int, float)It currently does not support and, or operators, but we plan to support them soon.Previous← Vanilla JSNextFloating Button →On this pageMendable Search BarUsageKeyword SearchPropsCallback functionsExampleExampleExampleMetadata Filtering (Beta)",https://docs.mendable.ai/components/search-bar,"{""title"":""Mendable Search Bar - Docs"",""language"":null,""description"":""Using Mendable Search Bar component.""}"

This endpoint enables a chat with the Mendable AI assistant, which provides responses based on the given question and history, and the project's documentation. We have added the retriever options - num_chunks params to the chat endpoint on our API. This allows people to pick how many information chunks the retriever will bring back.Ingesting your documentsFor this endpoint to work, your documents have to already be ingested in our system. To do that, go to our platform or schedule an intro call.We will soon provide a way to ingest documents through our API.Creating a conversationA conversation is a series of 'chats' between a user and a Mendable AI assistant. To be able to start chatting you should create a new conversation using the newConversation Mendable API endpoint. The endpoint will return a conversation_id which you can use to start a chat. Here is how to get a conversation_id in cURL:curl -X POST https://api.mendable.ai/v0/newConversation \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{
        ""api_key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",
      }'
Creating a chatNow that you have your conversation_id, you can use that to start chatting with your Mendable AI. You can also specify the number of information chunks you want the retriever to bring back by using the num_chunks parameter in the retriever_options.Example Usage with StreamingNote: You must be able to handle Server-Sent Events (SSE) events to capture the streamed tokens. See below the cURL example of how to do streaming in Javascript.RequestHere is an example request using cURL:curl -X POST https://api.mendable.ai/v0/mendableChat \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{
        ""api_key"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",
        ""question"": ""How do I create a new project?"",
        ""history"": [
          { ""prompt"" : ""How do I create a new project?"", ""response"" : ""You can create a new project by going to the projects page and clicking the new project button."" }
        ],
        ""conversation_id"": 12345,
        ""retriever_options"":{
          ""num_chunks"": 4
        },
      }'
or using JavaScript:Installing Microsoft Fetch Event SourceTo use streaming you need to capture Server-Sent Events (SSE). Performing a normal fetch won't work. Therefore, we recommend using the Microsoft Fetch Event Source library. This library allows you to easily handle SSE. Here is how to install it:npm install @microsoft/fetch-event-source
Example Codeimport { fetchEventSource } from '@microsoft/fetch-event-source'

const url = 'https://api.mendable.ai/v0/mendableChat'

const data = {
  api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  question: 'How do I create a new project?',
  history: [
    {
      prompt: 'How do I create a new project?',
      response:
        'You can create a new project by going to the projects page and clicking the new project button.',

Pay attention how the first chunk of the response is a special chunk that contains the metadata for the response. You can capture the chunk as it is sent as ""<|source|>"". The metadata is an array of objects, each containing the id, content and link of the source used to generate the response.The last chunk is a <|message_id|> which is the id of the message in Mendable.

See below for more details.retriever_optionsobjectfalseThis allows you to specify the number of information chunks the retriever will bring back.Metadata Filtering (Beta)You can filter out sources based on metadata. This is useful if you want to filter out sources based on the version of the document or any other metadata you have ingested. Metadata ingestion is currently only available through the /ingestDocuments endpoint.To use metadata filtering, use the where parameter when querying. Here is an example of what you need to do when calling the /mendableChat endpoint:{
  ""api_key"": """",
  ""question"": ""What does Jack play?"",
  ""history"":[],
  ""conversation_id"": 123145,
  ""shouldStream"":false,
  ""where"":{
     ""version"": {  ""$lte"": 6  } ,
     ""age"": {""$eq"": 22 }
  }
}
The where parameter is an object that contains the metadata you want to filter on. The key is the name of the metadata and the value is an object that contains the operator and the value you want to filter on.Metadata supports the following operators:$eq - equal to (string, int, float)$ne - not equal to (string, int, float)$gt - greater than (int, float)$gte - greater than or equal to (int, float)$lt - less than (int, float)$lte - less than or equal to (int, float)$in - matches any value in an array (string, int, float)It currently does not support and, or operators, but we plan to support them soon.ResponseThe response is sent as a series of Server-Sent Events (SSE). Each chunk of the AI-generated response is sent as a data event.Chunk <|source|> contains metadata for the souces of the content.Chunk <|message_id|> contains the id of the message in Mendable.All the other chunks are the AI-generated response that you can concat.data: {""chunk"" : ""<|source|>"" , ""metadata"": [{""id"": ""string"", ""content"": ""string"", ""link"": ""string""}]}
data: {""chunk"": ""To create a new project in Mendable, follow these steps:""}
data: {""chunk"": ""\n\n1. Log in to your Mendable account.""}
data: {""chunk"": ""\n2. Click the 'New Project' button in the dashboard.""}
data: {""chunk"": ""\n3. Fill in the required project details and click 'Create Project'.""}
data: {""chunk"": ""<|message_id|>"", ""metadata"" : 12345 }
Disabling StreamingAlternatively, you can disable streaming by passing the shouldStream parameter as false to the request. With streaming disabled, you can get the bots response from response body.Here is an example of the request body with streaming disabled:{
  ""question"": ""How to deploy my application?"",
  ""history"": [],
  ""anon_key"": ""<ANON_KEY>"",
  ""conversation_id"": ""<convo_id>"",
  ""shouldStream"": false
}
And this is the response:{
  ""answer"": {
    ""text"": ""This is how to deploy it...""
  },
  ""message_id"": 123,
  ""sources"": [
    {
      ""id"": 866,
      ""content"":"""",
      ""link"": """",
      ""relevance_score"": 0.99
    },
  ]
}

"Introducing Precise Mode for Mendable.aiSkip to contentMendableGetting startedUse CasesDocsPricingBlogOpen main menuSign InGet StartedJuly 27th, 2023Introducing Precise Mode for Mendable.aiA Solution for More Controlled AI ConversationsAre you tired of asking, ""How can I get my model to not talk about X?"" At Mendable.ai, we understand this concern. As creators and innovators in the AI space, we have heard this query more times than we can count. So, we decided to rise to the occasion and tackle this issue head-on. We are excited to unveil our latest feature - Precise Mode, developed with the assistance of our partners at LangChainAI.
Understanding How Precise Mode Works
Complexity is often seen as a mark of genius. However, sometimes the best solutions are the simplest. Our approach to refining AI conversation abides by this ethos, comprising two key components: a moderation layer and prompt templates.
The Moderation Layer
The first step in achieving more controlled AI responses is our moderation layer. It functions as a gatekeeper, flagging any requests that contain text we, or the client, would prefer the model not to attempt answering. For instance, any sensitive topics, inappropriate content, or areas outside the model's training can be flagged. If a user request is flagged, we provide feedback through a friendly, informative message, thus maintaining the user experience's quality while ensuring content suitability.
Prompt Templates
After the moderation layer comes the exciting part - prompt templates. These are developed in collaboration with LangChainAI, designed to further constrict the model's response parameters. For Precise Mode, we specify instructions like ""Do not make up any part of an answer. If the answer isn't in the sources, say X"". This approach ensures the AI responses adhere closely to the information available, providing the most accurate and helpful replies.
The Advantage of GPT-4 in Following Prompts
While we have designed the Precise Mode to be effective with various AI models, it's worth noting that GPT-4 has shown particularly promising results. GPT-4 follows these prompt directions far more reliably than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. If you're aiming for more consistent and controlled AI interactions, GPT-4 is the recommended choice with Precise Mode.
However, we understand that not everyone has transitioned to GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 remains a popular choice. Don't worry - we have you covered! There are specific prompt techniques that can considerably enhance the consistency of GPT-3.5. We are excited to share these tips in the future.
In conclusion, our latest feature - Precise Mode, aims to answer a longstanding question in AI conversation control. By combining a moderation layer with highly customized prompt templates, we offer a simple yet effective solution to controlling the topics your AI model can discuss. Welcome to a more precise, accurate, and controlled AI conversation experience with Mendable.ai.

Warning: Max number of documents is 500. There is also a limit of 2mb of documents per request, which is around 2,000,000 characters.Metadata and OptionsMetadata and options are optional parameters that can be included in the request.Metadata is a key-value pair that can be used to add additional information about the document. For example, you can include the version of the document or the author's name. This information can be used later for filtering purposes.Options is another key-value pair that can be used to specify how the document should be processed. For example, you can specify whether the document should be summarized and the maximum number of characters that should be included in the summary.summarize is a boolean that specifies whether the document should be summarized. The default value is false.summarize_max_chars is an integer that specifies the maximum number of characters that should be included in the summary. This is not guranteed, the AI will attempt to follow this limit but it may not be exact.Check Ingestion StatusThe ingestionStatus endpoint is part of the API, designed to check the status of an ongoing ingestion task. This function returns the status, metadata, and progress of the ingestion task.POST /api.mendable.ai/v0/ingestionStatus
